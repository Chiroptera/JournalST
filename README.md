# JournalST
A simple journaling plugin for SublimeText.

On plugin load (or when creating a file) a valid journal path must be set in the settings or an error dialog will show up. Use the "Preferences: JournalST - User" to specify the "journal_path" setting. The basic setting configuration can be seen with the "Preferences: JournalST - Default" command.
